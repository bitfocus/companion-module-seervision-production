## Seervision Production

This module will allow you to control Seervision Suite during your production.

### Available actions

- **Recall a container** - this action will recall a specific container.
- **Create a container** - this action will create a container with a specified configuration.
- **Start tracking** -- this action will initiate tracking, or switch tracked VIP as specified by the option.
- **Stop tracking** -- this action will stop tracking the VIP.
- **Toggle tracking** -- this action will toggle tracking state.

### Configuration

In order to set up module, you will need to specify IP on which the Seervision Suite can be reached. If you're not sure, you can find the IP in the [Operations Server](https://manual.seervision.com/#/getting_started?id=dop-ip-address).

### Troubleshooting

If an action does not work, it is possible that connection to the Seervision Suite got lost. If that's the case, you can use the **Reset Connection** action to reestablish the connection.
